## Deep-Learning Neural Network Algorithm for Visual-Binary Source Detection

We introduce a cutting-edge deep-learning methodology designed to detect visual-binary sources within stamp images downloaded from various astronomical surveys.

Fig. 3: Stacked images and 2D peak plot of source 00222 from 2MASS and ZTF surveys, showing no binary resolution.
Fig. 4: Same source from Pan-STARRS and SDSS9, where the binary source is resolved.
